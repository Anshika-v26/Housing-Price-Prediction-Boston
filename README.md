# Forecasting the success of fundraising through an ICO
The dataset contains information about ICO projects from various fundraising teams/companies.
This project uses several machine learning algorithms to forecast whether a team/company will successfully raise funds through an ICO. The study aims to compare the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for this specific dataset. After applying the four different approaches to the dataset, we can conclude that it SVM is a powerful algorithm that can achieve high accuracy in predicting the success of fundraising goals of companies.
