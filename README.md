# Forecasting success of fund raising through an ICO
The dataset contains information about ICO projects from various fundraising teams/companies.
This project uses several machine learning algorithms to forecast whether a team/company will successfully raise funds through an ICO. The study aims to compare the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for this specific dataset. After applying the four different approaches to the dataset, we can conclude that it SVM is a powerful algorithm that can achieve high accuracy in predicting the success of fundraising goals of companies.


Analysed housing price samples in Boston using XGBLinear ( Extreme Gradient Boosting) model. The model was cross-validated using 10 folds and tuned using the grid search method. The model had a high accuracy in predicting future housing prices in the Boston area.
